* Engineering Design

  - Application of science and engineering
  - Define structure of system in details
  - Allow manufacturers to be able to make it

* What about Mechanical Design?
  Mechanical engineers need to define

  - Materials
  - Dimensions
  - Shapes

  So that the designed product can function properly

* Engineering Design Processes

#+BEGIN_CENTER
\smartdiagram[circular diagram:clockwise]{Ask, Research, Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve}
#+END_CENTER

* Ask: What seems to be the problem?

  - What do you want to make?
  - Why is it needed?
  - What is the product supposed to do/not to do?

* Research: More details on the problems and products


  - Talk to customers to better understand problems and needs
  - Conduct independent research get a clearer picture
  - Look into previous works/products. What works? What doesn't?

* Imagine: Come up with conceptual design

  - Brainstorm ideas
  - Exchange opinions on different solutions

* Plan: How should we proceed?

  - Check problems, needs, constrains
  - Evaluate ideas and select the best one
  - Plan how to move forward

* Create: Make it happen

  - Design the components
  - Respect constraints and requirements developed earlier
  - Build prototype and verify


* Test: Does it work?

  - Perform analysis and test on prototype
  - Use in actual operating conditions
  - Get feed back from customers
  - Evaluate what needs improvement


* Improve: Make it better

  - Redesign and improve based on feedback and tests


* Application of Engineering Design: Lawn Mower

  - So many lawn in Thammasat
  - How do you keep them all nice and tidy?


* Scisscors?

* Machete?
  \begin{center}

  \end{center}

* Lawn Mower?
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./pictures/lawn-mower.jpg}
  \end{center}

* Case Study: Grass Cutting Solution

  - Lawn Mowers \(\rightarrow\) fast, but cumbersome
  - Shears/Machete \(\rightarrow\) slow, portable

    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{figure}

* Can we do any better? Something in between?

  - Make one yourself


* Defining Key Component

    - What is the most important component in a grass cutting device?
    - A component that completes the main function
    - For a grass-cutter device $\rightarrow$ the cutting mechanism


* The cutting mechanism... obviously

  - blade, shear, \ldots{}

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./pictures/mower-blade.jpg}
  \end{center}

* Key Analysis: Shearing Force
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./pictures/cutting.jpg}
  \end{center}

* Same problem, different approach

  - blade \(\rightarrow\) hard, sharp, but moving slowly
  - can something softer, but moving fast does the same job?


* Fast spinning wires?
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{./pictures/cutter-wire.jpg}
  \end{center}

* Problem \(\rightarrow\) Component

  - Define what needs to be done
  - Be specific
  - Most design problems already have partial solutions


* Defining constraints

  - Deadline?
  - Budget?
  - Load requirements?


* Finding best solution

  - Systematic method
  - Validate & evaluate possible solutions


* FRDPARRC Chart

- FR :: Functional Requirements $\rightarrow$ what job does it have?
- DP :: Design Parameters $\rightarrow$  what dimensions/shapes/materials does the job?
- A :: Analysis $\rightarrow$ how would you determine that proper DP?
- R :: References $\rightarrow$ where do you get that method(s) from?
- R :: Risks $\rightarrow$ is there any potential problems from your design?
- C :: Countermeasures $\rightarrow$ how do you solve that potential problem?

  - Goal: obtain scraped/minced coconut meat for squeezing into coconut milk

* Major Design Considerations

  - Strength
  - Deformation
  - Uncertainty


* Strength vs Stress
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./pictures/strength-stress.jpg}
  \end{center}
  \begin{equation*}
    strength < stress \rightarrow failure
  \end{equation*}

* Deformation
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{./pictures/deformed-beam.jpg}
  \end{center}

* How sure are you about \ldots{}

  - your design calculation(s)?


  - your supplier specifications?


  - your customer knowledge?


  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./pictures/overloaded-truck.jpg}
  \end{center}

* Safety Factor!
  \alert{What is that?}

* Safety Factor
  Component should be stronger than the required stress


  - The stronger, the safer it is

  $$ N_s = \frac{\text{Strength}}{\text{Stress}} $$
  - ``Strength'' and ``Stress'' depend on material and criterion in consideration


* The Safer, The Better \ldots right?
  The bigger safety factor, the safer your component is

  So why don't we design everything with a N\(_{\text{s}}\) = 100000

* Too Much of a Good Thing
  Is there a cost for \emph{excessive} safety factor?

* Total Safety Factor


    - A choice of safety factor is a combination of mainly two considerations

        - design and usage conditions: how \underline{well} something should be design and manufactured and how \underline{badly} it will be treated.
        - economic and safety factors: how bad it is going to be when it fails.

  

  \begin{align*}
   N_s = N_{s, cond} N_{s, econ}
  \end{align*}
